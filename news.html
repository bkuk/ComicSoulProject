                    <p>The new Suicide Squad movie trailer has been released!
                        It showcases a beautiful new cast of characters and
                        some returning ones too. Joel Kinnaman will return as
                        Rick Flag. Viola Davis will return as Amanda Waller.
                        Jai Courtney is returning as Captain Boomerang. And of
                        course we have Margot Robbie returning as Harley Quinn!
                        Fans can expect new things out of this film, as it is a
                        rated R movie. The director of the film, James Gunn, said
                        this movie deserved this rating for a number of reasons.
                        While it does seem as though it will have a similar atmosphere
                        to the last film, it seems that this one will be a bit more
                        graphic in terms of the script and action.</p>

                    <p>The Flash is going to be on the big screen once again. In 2022, you can expect to see The Flash
                        Movie. There have been a number of teasers and leaked photos from the film already, but recently
                        Warner Bros. released a teaser of the hero’s logo. Something to note in the upcoming film is
                        that we will see Michael Keaton return as Batman! However, he’s not just Batman in this. He
                        plays the future version of Bruce Wayne. It is assumed that he is an older Bruce that has gone
                        through the worst experiences imaginable. </p>

                    <p>Last year, we were all waiting for the Black Widow movie to release in theaters. We almost got
                        there too, but due to some unfortunate circumstances the film’s release had to be delayed a bit.
                        But wait no further! The Black Widow movie will be released in theaters on July 9! This is huge
                        considering that they delayed this movie for so long. But now, it seems to be on track with all
                        the other projects that Marvel has for the next few years. It’s been a rough year, so let’s go
                        enjoy us some MCU!</p>

                    <p>Spider-Man: No Way Home is set to release this Christmas time, on December 17. This film has been
                        a huge controversial topic among Spider-Man fans. Fans have been discussing what this movie will
                        be about and if past Spider-Man film actors will also cameo in the film. They were all hoping
                        for Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield on the big screen as Spider-Men once again. However, I
                        believe it is all still up in the air. These outrageous predictions started when they moved onto
                        their next phase in the MCU, so hopefully fans won’t get their hopes up this time.</p>

                    last few years. Although the newest trilogy was disliked by Star Wars fans, there have been many
                    other pieces of work that are still loved. For example, The Mandalorian. This was a hit, although it
                    was not specifically about Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader. Disney seems to be pumping out content
                    like no other with all of the new Marvel and Star Wars editions to Disney+.

                <p>New episodes of Invincible can be watched on Amazon Prime! This is a brand new animated superhero
                    show based on the comic book from Image Comics. This show is definitely a change of pace from
                    anything DC or Marvel. This show is considered an adult animated superhero show, much like The Boys
                    on Amazon. And they are very similar in the fact that it is a very explicit, graphic show. People
                    get torn apart and ripped in half, so it’s not exactly something to watch with the kids. Check it
                    out now on Amazon Prime!</p>
