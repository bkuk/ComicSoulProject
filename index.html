                    <h2>Batman</h2>
                    <p>Batman is a classic American character from DC Comics. Batman was first introduced in 1939 by
                        artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger. Although his debut was a bit silly, over the years,
                        Batman has
                        become an increasingly dark character. He became famous for the dark, bruting hero that will do
                        anything he can to solve the mystery. Batman is famously known for being the greatest detective,
                        and he proves that through his countless victories. By day, he is Bruce Wayne. A playboy,
                        millionaire that inherited his parents company, Wayne Enterprise. By night, he is the Dark
                        Knight.
                        The caped crusader who instills fear into the heart of criminals.

                    <h2>Joker</h2>
                    <p>Much like Batman, the Joker is no stranger to most American households. Created by Bill Finger,
                        Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson, the character was first introduced as Batman’s villain in 1940.
                        This character has had an interesting history. At first, the Joker was going to be killed off
                        but it was later decided to keep using him. His personality has changed over the last 80 years.
                        In the 50s, they had introduced the Joker as a very comical, goofy character. But then by the
                        70s, they had returned to the crazy, psychopath that we all know and love. The character’s
                        origin story is also a bit of a mystery. Sometimes he is portrayed as someone who used to be a
                        former gangster and was in an accident to cause him to become the Joker. Sometimes he is
                        portrayed as a hero, The Red Hood. Most of the time, he is an enigma. No one knows where he came
                        from. They all just think his existence was sprouted by the Batman.
